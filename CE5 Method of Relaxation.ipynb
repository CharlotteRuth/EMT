    "Relaxation is an iterative method that can be used to analytically solve a boundary-value problem such as Laplace's equation. As you may remember from Griffiths (look at page 114-119), the two main properties of the Laplace equation are that V(x) is always the average of the potential of the points around it, and that Laplace's equation tolerates no local extrema. \n",

    "1. Define the boundary values of V along the boundary\n",
